# The First TOP Project: Recipes
This is the first TOP project which consists of creating a basic recipe website. The website will have a main index page with links to a few recipes. 

The website might not look pretty but that's fine since this is mainly the HTML-based project. Further on, when CSS will be learned, the project will be revisited and modified.
